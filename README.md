# CI/CD Pipeline for Deploying a Python Application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using AWS CodePipeline
This repository contains code and instructions for setting up a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline for deploying a Python application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using AWS CodePipeline.

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, you will need the following:

- An AWS account with permissions to create Elastic Beanstalk environments and CodePipeline pipelines.
- A Python application with its dependencies and source code committed to a source code repository such as GitHub or AWS CodeCommit.

## Setup
- Create an Elastic Beanstalk environment: First, create an Elastic Beanstalk environment for your application. You can do this using the Elastic Beanstalk console or the AWS CLI.

- Create a CodePipeline: Create a new CodePipeline in the AWS Management Console, and configure it to use the source code repository where your application code is stored. You will also need to configure the pipeline to use the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deploy action, which will deploy your code to your Elastic Beanstalk environment.

- Configure the CodeBuild project: In the CodePipeline, you will need to create a CodeBuild project that will build and package your application code. You can use the AWS-provided build environment or create a custom build environment.Here, i just skipped the CodeBuild part.

- Configure the Elastic Beanstalk Deploy action: In the CodePipeline, configure the Elastic Beanstalk Deploy action to deploy your code to your Elastic Beanstalk environment. You will need to specify the environment name, the application version, and any other required parameters.

- Trigger the pipeline: Once your pipeline is configured, you can trigger it to deploy your code to your Elastic Beanstalk environment. You can do this manually or set up triggers to automatically deploy changes when new code is committed to your source code repository.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can deploy your Python application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk using AWS CodePipeline. This will enable you to automate the deployment process, reduce errors, and deliver changes to your users faster and more reliably. If you have any questions or issues with this setup, please consult the AWS documentation or reach out to the AWS support team.
